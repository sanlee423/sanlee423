# Hi there üëã

## About me üòä

üî≠&nbsp;I am David Lee, a **Full-Stack Developer** with experience in various languages and platforms.

üå±&nbsp;I enjoy learning new frameworks and technology and am slowly trying to contribute to more **Open Source Projects**. I have professionally worked as a software engineer since 2015 after graduating from **Indiana University - Bloomington**. Since 2015, I have learnt **Javascript, C#, .NET, Java, SQL,  Express**. with a focus on the backend. After 2017 I shifted towards a more Full-Stack engineering role and have learned **Typescript, SASS, Postgresql, MongoDB, React, NextJS, AWS, GCP** and more.

üí¨&nbsp;In my free time I love to spend time taking **photos, trying new food, reading, coding and listening to music** to name a few things.

üì∑&nbsp;I am an avid photographer. I love to explore the world with my camera and have been taking photos since I was in elementary school. I've also previously run my own film lab and run a Youtube Channel about Photography and Film Development.

üìï&nbsp;I usually enjoy reading books on **Personal Development** and **Financial Literacy**, and my current favorites are **Atomic Habits** by James Clear and **A Tale of Two Cities** by Charles Dickens.
